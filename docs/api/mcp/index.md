# MCP Protocol

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the communication bridge between CiteKit's local index and the AI agent's reasoning engine. It allows Claude, Cursor, or Cline to "see" inside your files.

| **Tools** | The functions shared with the agent (list, resolve). | [MCP Tools](/api/mcp/tools) |

## Philosophy

CiteKit as an MCP server acts as a **Read-Only Virtual Filesystem**. To the agent, it looks like a set of tools that can suddenly "unlock" a specific 30-second clip from a 2-hour video, or a single chart from a 100-page PDF.

## Protocol Security

-   **Transport**: Runs over standard `stdio`.
-   **Local-Only**: No data is sent to CiteKit servers.
-   **Limited Scope**: The server only has access to files you explicitly `ingest` or provide via `base_dir`.
